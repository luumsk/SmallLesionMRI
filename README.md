# SmallLesionMRI

This repository contains research code and experiments focused on
**detecting and segmenting subtle brain lesions in MRI** using deep
learning methods.

The primary motivation is to improve **lesion sensitivity and recall**,
particularly for very small or low-contrast lesions that are often
missed by standard segmentation pipelines.


## Scope

This project investigates:

- Limitations of popular deep learning architectures in small lesion
  segmentation
- Factors that cause missed detections (resolution, loss functions,
  sampling strategies, and evaluation protocols)
- Methodological directions to improve sensitivity without excessive
  false positives

Target applications include:
- Multiple Sclerosis lesion segmentation
- Brain tumor and metastasis detection
- General pathological brain lesion analysis in MRI


## Status

**Work in progress**

This repository is under active development as part of ongoing research.
Code, experiments, and documentation will be updated incrementally.
